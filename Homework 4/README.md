# Homework 4
## 4.1 Flatland
For this homework assignment, you are to use 2D images to texture map simple polygons.

- Create a scene comprised of at least three simple 2D shapes (at least one plane(quad) and one triangle, each with a separate texture). Include two orthogonal planes with a separate texture on each.
  - This might be a wood "floor" and a "brick wall" or a "grassy meadow" with a "sky" background
- Add a triangle somewhere in the scene and texture map it with a third image. (This might be a "tree" or a "boulder")
- Alternatively, you can create any 3D figure with at least two quads and one triangle and three textures to create some figure you have interest in, such as a boat, a house or similar.
- Incorporate a method of viewing the scene from different camera views.
- You may provide one of three ways of reading your data: with a file chooser, by including image data as a javascript array or by setting up a URL resource. Include a README file with your submission explaining the method.
