# Homework 5
Use multiple shaders to provide a menu of special effects to be applied to a 2D texture used to hold a photograph.
## 5.1 FragmentShaderSelfie
For this homework assignment, you are to use 2D images to texture map simple polygons.

- Use your webcam to provide an image source if you have one. ( Most fun - use the video stream and use each frame as a texture )
- Create at least three program GLSL program objects, each with a different fragment shader to apply different image processing effects to your image. (You may or may not use different vertex shaders.)
- Use a menu input to select the shader to apply.
